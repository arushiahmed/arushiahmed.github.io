				<p>My name is Arushi Ahmed; My name is Arushi Ahmed and I am a software engineer at Comcast. My role includes being a technical leader for in-house development projects, managing intake and release processes, and providing support for billing data inquiries. I graduated at University of Massachusetts Amherst with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics with a minor in IT and Psychology in 2020.</p>

				
				<p>My area of focus is Human-Computer Interaction because I want to help improve or build new technology for users. From HCI it has helped me develop other areas of interest such as Web Development, iOS Development, and Natural Language Processing. I am the Undergraduate Course Chair Assistant to teach Web Programming course to help students succeed in the course. I have recently done Human-Computer Interaction research on what types of stresses do international students have and how students cope with their stresses while studying in the United States. </p>

				<p>One reason why I decided to major in computer science is from my brother. In 8th grade, my brother came home and asked me if I wanted to help him build a computer. The idea that anyone can build a computer did not make sense to me but I was like sure. After putting all the parts together and saw how I was able to build a computer on my own, that changed my world. I realized that moment that I wanted a career that involves computers. Four years later, my high school offered its first computer science class, and that was when I knew I wanted to major in computer science. Another reason is that I want to help people. Technology has been rapidly growing and has been making tasks easier for people's lives. After building my first iOS application and learning about Android Development, it opened my eyes seeing that I was able to create a product that could make someone's life simpler. As for majoring in mathematics, that even surprised me. I remember telling myself in middle school that I do not want a career that involved math. It is funny how life changes sometimes. Taking a few math courses and seeing math at a different level, I wanted to pursue another degree in mathematics. </p>
					

				<p>During my time in school, I was very involved in many activities. I was the Co-Chairs for Women in Computer Science at Umass. I became president of the organization and I am excited to create a stronger bond between all-female and non-binary members of the CS community for the 2019-2020 school year. I was member of the UMass Club Swim Team. I have swam throughout high school and been blessed to be able to continue in college. Another organization I was a part of at UMass called Changing Health Attitudes + Actions to Recreate Girls Club (CHAARG). It is a national organization that is dedicated to inspiring women to find their fit in health and fitness. I was involved in Relay for Life where we raise money for the American Cancer Society. I started being apart of Relay for Life in seventh grade inspired by my science teacher and been able to continue since then. I know friends, family, and myself that have been personally affected by cancer. This follows one of the biggest activities I do over the summer is the Michelle Farnsworth Field Hockey Tournament. This Tournament is in honor of my friend Michelle Farnsworth who passed away in January 2015 from cancer. I am thankful that I am able to honor and keep Michelle's memory alive. Michelle was not just a field hockey player, she was also an amazing artist. With permission from her family, I was able to trasform her artwork into stickers and sell them on <a href="https://society6.com/michellefarnsworthart" class="onlink" style="color: black; text-decoration: none"> Society6. </a></p>
