				<p> My name is Arushi Ahmed; I am currently a senior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics with a minor in IT and Psychology.</p>

				<p>	My area of focus is Human Computer Interaction because I want to help improve or build new technology for users. From HCI it has helped me develop other areas of interest such as Web Development, iOS Development, and Natural Language Processing. I am the Undergraduate Course Chair Assistant to teach Web Programming course to help students succeed in the course. I have recently done Human Computer Interaction research on what types of stresses do international students have and how students cope with their stresses while studying in the United States.

				One reason why I decided to major in computer science is from my brother. In 8th grade, my brother came home and asked me if I wanted to help him build a computer. The idea that anyone can build a computer did not make sense to me but I was like sure. After putting all the parts together and saw how I was able to build a computer on my own, that changed my world. I realized that moment that I wanted a career that involves computers. Four years later, my high school offered its first computer science class, and that was when I knew I wanted to major in computer science. Another reason is because I want to help people. Technology has been rapidly growing and has been making tasks easier for peoples lives. After building my first iOS application and learning about Android Development, it opened my eyes seeing that I was able to create a product that could make someone life simpler. As for majoring in mathematics, that even surprised me. I remember telling myself in middle school that I do not want a career that involved math. It is funny how life changes sometimes. Taking a few math couses and seeing math at a different level, I wanted to purse another degree in mathematics.

				<p>Outside of my schoolwork, I am involved in many activities. I am a Co-Chairs for Women in Computer Science at Umass. This year I became president of the organization and I am excited to create a stronger bond between all female and non-binary members of the CS community for the 2019-2020 school year. I am also a member of the UMass Club Swim Team. I have swam throughout high school and been blessed to be able to continue in college. Another organzation I am part of at UMass called Changing Health Attitudes + Actions to Recreate Girls Club (CHAARG). It is a national organzation that is dedicated to inspiring women to find their fit in health and fitness. I am involved in Relay for Life where we rasie money for the American Cancer Society. I started being apart of Relay for Life in seventh grade inspried by my science teacher and been able to contuine since then.I know friends, family, and myself that have been personally effected by cancer. This follows to one of the biggest actitives I do over the summer is the Michelle Farsnworth Field Hockey Tournament. This Tournament is in honor of my friend Michelle Farnsworth who passed away January 2015 from cancer. I am thankful that I am able to honor and keep Michelle's memory alive. Michelle was not just a field hockey player, she was also an amazing artist. With permission from her family, I was able to trasform her artwork into stickers and sell them on <a href="https://society6.com/michellefarnsworthart" class="onlink" style="color: black; text-decoration: none"> Society6. </a></p>

				<p>I am happy to announce that after graduation will be working for Comcast NBCUniversal as a Software Engineer. Thank you to everyone who has helped me along the way to get me where I am today.</p>
